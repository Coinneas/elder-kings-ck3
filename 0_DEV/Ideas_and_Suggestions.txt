ToDo:
- Give Dillonn a character in the mod
- (ESO) Calantius as Skingrad Count
- add savanna terrain_type for Reapers March, other parts of Elsweyr.

Just a spot to save some suggestions and ideas:
- Mine buildings for holdings as in ck3 vanilla. Some special mines at special places. E.g. that one special orichalcum mine near Wayrest; silver mines in the Reach.
