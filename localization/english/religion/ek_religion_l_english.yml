Others Gods include Zeht, Tall Papa's wife Morwha, Tava, HoonDing, Leki, Onsi, Diagna and Tu'whacca, who was thought to be some sort of god of apathy before the creation of the world, when he became a caretaker and protector of souls. The Yokudan creation myth involved Sep, a "crazy" merchant god who convinced the others to create the mortal world to make it easier for more spirits to survive Satakal's inevitable onslaught. Except it didn't make it easier. Rather, the mortal plane acts as a trap and makes apotheosis even harder.
